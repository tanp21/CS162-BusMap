# CS162-BusMap

## Ho Chi Minh City Bus Route Optimizer with AI Integration üöåüó∫Ô∏è

### Project Overview  
A sophisticated route optimization system that combines public transit navigation with local AI processing to deliver optimal bus routes in Ho Chi Minh City. Leverages graph theory algorithms and a locally-hosted Mistral7B large language model for natural language interactions.

### Key Features ‚ú®
- **Smart Pathfinding Engine**  
  Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate shortest-path distances between locations using Ho Chi Minh City's bus network

- **Multi-Stage Route Guidance**  
  Provides complete itineraries with:
  - Boarding stop locations
  - Bus route numbers
  - Transfer points
  - Total travel duration estimates

- **AI-Powered Natural Interface**  
  Local Mistral7B LLM deployment via Ollama enables:
  - Conversational query processing
  - Intent recognition for location extraction
  - Automatic function triggering for path calculations
  - Context-aware response generation

### Data
- The data are hidden due to copyright policy of the course

### Requirements üì¶
- Python 3.10+
- Ollama runtime environment
- Mistral-7B-instruct model
- 8GB+ RAM recommended
